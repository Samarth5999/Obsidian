## Additional Notes

* All 53 reserved words contains lower-case alphabet.
- In java, we have only `new`keyword and there is no `delete`keyword because destruction of useless objects is the responsibility of garbage collector.
- `void`: In java written type is mandatory, if a method wonâ€™t return anything then we have to declare that method with `void` return type.
- `goto` : Usage of `goto` created several problems in old languages and hence some banned this keyword in java.
- `const`: Use final instead of `const`.
- `goto` and `const` are unused keywords and if we are trying to use we will get compile time error.
- `enum`: We can use `enum` to define a group of named constants](<- All reserved words in Java are lowercase.
- Java has only the `new` keyword; **no `delete`** (memory managed by Garbage Collector).
- `void`: Used when a method returns nothing.
- `enum`: Introduced in Java 1.5, defines a set of named constants.>)
