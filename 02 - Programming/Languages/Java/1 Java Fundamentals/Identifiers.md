A name in JAVA program is called **identifier** which can be used for identification purpose, it can be method name, variable name, class name or label name.

```java
class test{
public static void main(String[] args){
int x = 10;
system.out.println(x);
	}
}
```
No. of identifiers = 5; `test, main, String, args and x`

### Rules for defining Java Identifiers:

1. `a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, $ and _`.
2. Identifier can’t starts with digit.
3. There is no length limit for java identifiers.
4. We can’t use Reserved Words for identifiers.
5. All predefined JAVA class and interface names, **we can use as identifiers**. Example: `String`, `Runnable`etc.
