We can use new operator to create object. Ex: `Test t = new Test();`
Note:
1. After creating a object, constructer(`Test()`) will be executed to perform initialization of the object, hence constructer is not for creation of object and it is for initialization of an object only.
2. In Java, we have only new keyword but not delete keyword because destruction of useless objects is the responsibility of the garbage collector.

# [] Operator
We can use this operator to declare and create arrays. Ex: `int [] = new int[10]`
