# Flat-file Database

Spreadsheets like those created in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets can be outputted to a `csv` or _comma-separated values_ file. If you look at a `csv` file, youâ€™ll notice that the file is flat in that all of our data is stored in a single table represented by a text file. We call this form of data a _flat-file database_. All data is stored row by row. Each column is separated by a comma or another value.

```python
import csv

# Open CSV file
with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:

    # Create reader
    reader = csv.reader(file)

    # Skip header row
    next(reader)

    # Iterate over CSV file, printing each favorite
    for row in reader:
        print(row[1])
```
Notice that the `csv` library is imported. Further, we created a `reader` that will hold the result of `csv.reader(file)`. The `csv.reader` function reads each row from the file, and in our code, we store the results in `reader`. `print(row[1])`, therefore, will print the language from the `favorites.csv` file.

One of the disadvantages of the above approach is that we are trusting that `row[1]` is always the favorite. However, what would happen if the columns had been moved around?

We can fix this potential issue. Python also allows you to index by the keys of a list. Modify your code as follows:
```python
import csv

# Open CSV file
with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:

    # Create DictReader
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)

    # Iterate over CSV file, printing each favorite
    for row in reader:
        print(row["language"])
```
Notice that this example directly utilizes the `language` key in the print statement. `favorite` indexes into the `reader` dictionary of `row["language"]`.

To count the number of favorite languages expressed in the `csv` file, we can do the following:

```python
import csv

# Open CSV file
with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:

    # Create DictReader
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)

    # Counts
    scratch, c, python = 0, 0, 0

    # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
    for row in reader:
        favorite = row["language"]
        if favorite == "Scratch":
            scratch += 1
        elif favorite == "C":
            c += 1
        elif favorite == "Python":
            python += 1

# Print counts
print(f"Scratch: {scratch}")
print(f"C: {c}")
print(f"Python: {python}")
```

Python allows us to use a dictionary to count the `counts` of each language. Consider the following improvement upon our code:
    
```python
    # Counts favorites using dictionary
    
    import csv
    
    # Open CSV file
    with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
    
        # Create DictReader
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    
        # Counts
        counts = {}
    
        # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
        for row in reader:
            favorite = row["language"]
            if favorite in counts:
                counts[favorite] += 1
            else:
                counts[favorite] = 1
    
    # Print counts
    for favorite in counts:
        print(f"{favorite}: {counts[favorite]}")
```
    
Notice that the value in `counts` with the key `favorite` is incremented when it exists already. If it does not exist, we define `counts[favorite]` and set it to 1. Further, the formatted string has been improved to present the `counts[favorite]`.
    
Python also allows sorting `counts`. Improve your code as follows:
    
```python
    # Sorts favorites by key
    
    import csv
    
    # Open CSV file
    with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
    
        # Create DictReader
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    
        # Counts
        counts = {}
    
        # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
        for row in reader:
            favorite = row["language"]
            if favorite in counts:
                counts[favorite] += 1
            else:
                counts[favorite] = 1
    
    # Print counts
    for favorite in sorted(counts):
        print(f"{favorite}: {counts[favorite]}")
```
    
Notice the `sorted(counts)` at the bottom of the code.
    
If you look at the parameters for the `sorted` function in the Python documentation, you will find it has many built-in parameters. You can leverage some of these built-in parameters as follows:
    
```python
    # Sorts favorites by value using .get
    
    import csv
    
    # Open CSV file
    with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
    
        # Create DictReader
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    
        # Counts
        counts = {}
    
        # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
        for row in reader:
            favorite = row["language"]
            if favorite in counts:
                counts[favorite] += 1
            else:
                counts[favorite] = 1
    
    # Print counts
    for favorite in sorted(counts, key=counts.get, reverse=True):
        print(f"{favorite}: {counts[favorite]}")
```
    
Notice the arguments passed to `sorted`. The `key` argument allows you to tell Python the method you wish to use to sort items. In this case `counts.get` is used to sort by the values. `reverse=True` tells `sorted` to sort from largest to smallest.
    
- Python has numerous libraries that we can utilize in our code. One of these libraries is `collections`, from which we can import `Counter`. `Counter` will allow you to access the counts of each language without the headaches of all the `if` statements seen in our previous code. You can implement as follows:
    
```python
    # Sorts favorites by value using .get
    
    import csv
    
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Open CSV file
    with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
    
        # Create DictReader
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    
        # Counts
        counts = Counter()
    
        # Iterate over CSV file, counting favorites
        for row in reader:
            favorite = row["language"]
            counts[favorite] += 1
    
    # Print counts
    for favorite, count in counts.most_common():
        print(f"{favorite}: {count}")
    ```
    
    Notice how `counts = Counter()` enables the use of this imported `Counter` class from `collections`.
