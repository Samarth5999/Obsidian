## 1D Array
Any location in an array can be accessed with the help of base address. The formula used by compiler to convert is $$Address(A[i]) = L_{o} + (i * w)$$
where, $L_o$ is base address
$i$ is Index
$w$ is the size of Data Type

* Base address of any array will be updated when the program starts running and once the memory is allocated. So the address of this is known during run time.
* As the base address is relative the formula for it is also relative formula.
