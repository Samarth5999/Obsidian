>[!important] Definition
>Let V(F) be a vector space over a field F and $U \subseteq F$ then U is said to be a subspace if U(F) is a vector space w.r.t same operations. 

>[!important] Definition-2
>$U\subseteq V$ is a subspace of V if it satisfies two properties:
>1. $0 \in U$ (Additive Identity)
>2. $\alpha u + \beta v \in U$ OR $\alpha u \in U$ OR $u + v \in V$

##### Trivial Subspaces

Every vector space V has at least two **subspaces**: the whole space itself V ⊆ V and the vector space consisting of the single element the zero vector, {0} ⊆ V.
