To find equivalent matrices, following operations are allowed on any matrices:-

##### 1. Row Interchange
=> $R_{i} \to R_{j}$

##### 2. Multiply all elements of row by non-zero constant 
=> $R_{i} \to KR_{i}\space; \enspace K\neq 0 \space i.e \space constant$

##### 3. To the element of row, we add k times the corresponding elements of another row, where K is a non-zero constant
=> $R_{i} \to R_{i} +KR_{j}$
