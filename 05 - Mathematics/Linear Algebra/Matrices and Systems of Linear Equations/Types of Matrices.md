We can categories [[Matrices]] as follows:-
### Zero Matrix
The zero matrix, denoted by 0, can be any size and is a matrix consisting of all zero elements.
Multiplication by a zero matrix results in a zero matrix.

### Identity Matrix
The identity matrix, denoted by I, is a square matrix (number of rows equals number of columns) with 1s down the main diagonal.
Multiplication by the identity matrix leaves the matrix unchanged.

### Diagonal Matrix
A diagonal matrix has its only nonzero elements on the diagonal.  $$D = \begin{pmatrix} d_{1} & 0 \\ 0&d_{2}\end{pmatrix}$$
### Band or Banded Matrix
A band (or banded) matrix has nonzero elements only on diagonal bands. 
For example :a three-by-three band matrix with nonzero diagonals one above and one below a nonzero main diagonal (called a tridiagonal matrix) is given by $$B = \begin{pmatrix}d_{1}&a_{1}&0 \\ b_{1}&d_{2}&a_{2}\\0&b_{2}&d_{3}\end{pmatrix}$$
### Upper Lower Triangular Matrix
An upper or lower triangular matrix is a square matrix that has zero elements below or above the diagonal.
$$U = \begin{pmatrix}a&b&c\\ 0&d&e\\0&0&0\end{pmatrix}, \thinspace L = \begin{pmatrix}a&0&0\\ b&d&0\\c&e&0\end{pmatrix}$$
