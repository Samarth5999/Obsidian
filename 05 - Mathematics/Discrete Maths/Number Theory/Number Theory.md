The branch of mathematics that involves integers, and the properties of integer is called <span style="color:rgb(253, 223, 126)">Number Theory</span>.
It has important applications in *Cryptography* and Network Security

#### Representation of Integers
$$xyz = x \times 10^3 + x \times 10^2 + z \times 10^3$$
Similarly, in base 2, we can write in the linear combination of powers of 2.
We can also convert from decimal to binary or vice versa.

# Prime Numbers

> [!important] Definition
> The positive integers that have only 1 and themselves as positive divisors are called prime numbers.

A positive integer that is greater than 1 and is not prime is called <span style="color:rgb(253, 223, 126)">composite</span>.

#### Relative Prime

>[!important] Definition
>The integers a and b are relatively prime if their gcd is 1.
