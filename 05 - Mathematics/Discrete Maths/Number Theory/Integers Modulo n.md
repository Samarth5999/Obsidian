Zn is formed by considering all possible remainders when integers are divided by n.

>[!example] 
>In $Z_{5}$, the elements are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. If you add 7 and 8 in $Z_{5}$, you get 7 + 8 = 15, and 15 mod 5 = 0, so 7 + 8 = 0 in $Z_{5}$.



Arithmetic Modulo m defines the set: $Z_{m}=\{0,1,2,\dots,m-1\}$
It is called the <span style="color:rgb(253, 223, 126)">set of residues of the positive integer m</span>.

#### Addition Module m
$$a +_{m} b = (a + b) \mod{m}$$

#### Multiplication Modulo m
$$a *_{m} b = (a * b) \mod{m}$$
