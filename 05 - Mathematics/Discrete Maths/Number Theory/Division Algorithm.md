>[!important] Definition
>Let $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b>0$, then there exist unique integers q and r, with $0 ≤ r < b$, such that $a = bq + r$.
$$a \bmod{b} = r$$
**"a mod b = r" means that** **r is the remainder when _a is divided by b_.**

>[!example] 
>1. $101=11*9+2 \implies 101\bmod 11 = 2$
>2. $-11=3*(-4)+1 \implies -11 \bmod 3 = 1$
>3. If a = -15 and b = 4 then $-15 = 4\times-4 + 1$
