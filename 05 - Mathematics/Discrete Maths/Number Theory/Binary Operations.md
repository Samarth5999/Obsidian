> [!important] Definition
> Let A be a non-empty set. Then, a function $*: A \times A \to A$ is called a **binary operation** on A.

That is, the operation * takes **two elements** from A and gives **one element** in A.

> [!example] Example-1
> In Integers, +, -, and $\times$ operations are binary but division is not binary because dividing two numbers doesn't always gives an Integer.

> [!example] Example-2
> $F : \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}, \quad F(a, b) = \frac{ab}{2}$ is a binary operation since the product of two rationals divided by 2 is still rational.


>[!example] Example-3
>$F : \mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}, \quad F(a, b) = a$ is **not** a binary operation in a proper sense because it **ignores** the second input.

### Summary

A function \( * : A \times A \to A \) is a **binary operation** if:
- The operation uses both elements.
- The result is in the same set \( A \).
