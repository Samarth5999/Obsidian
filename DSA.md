A program is a set of instruction which performs operations on data to get some results.

The way you organize the data in the main memory during execution time of a program that is data structure.

Depending on the requirements of the program, the type of procedures it is performing, we have various data structures.

So here the list of data structures:
1. Arrays
2. Matrices
3. Linked List
4. Stack
5. Queues
6. Trees
7. Graph 
8. Hashing

* Arrays, Matrices and Linked List are usually called as Physical Data Structure, they define how the data is arranged in the memory.
* Stack, Queues, Trees, Graph and Hashing are usually called Logical Data Structure, they define how data can be utilized.
