## Physical Data Structure
Defines how memory is organized and allocated. They actually store data.

#### 1. Arrays
- Contiguous memory locations.
- Fixed size → cannot increase/decrease.
- Can be created in **stack or heap**.
- Use when maximum number of elements is known.

#### 2. Linked List
- Collection of nodes linked to next node.
- Variable length → can grow or shrink dynamically.
- Always created in heap.
- Use when size is not known.

## Logical Data Structure
Define how data is used / operations discipline. Implemented using physical data structures (array, linked list, or combination).


- **Stack** → LIFO (Last In First Out)
- **Queue** → FIFO (First In First Out)
- **Trees** → hierarchical / non-linear
- **Graphs** → nodes and links
- **Hash Table** → tabular
