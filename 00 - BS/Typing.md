  Current WPM: 30
  
For the next 5 work days dedicate 20 minutes a day to doing these practice exercises.

- 10 minutes before lunch, 10 minutes after lunch.
- You can break these 10 minutes up, but please make sure you’re doing at least 20 minutes a day.
- During all of these tests you should be trying your hardest to never look at your keyboard. Try to focus on not looking during regular work day typing as well.
- Focus on accuracy over speed at all times, even when you’re taking tests at the end of each day.
- Use the same keyboard for all of this practice.

NOTES:

- Try to do all of these activities at least once unless they seem too hard.
- I’d suggest starting with an easy activity first and then moving onto the harder ones.
- At the end of each day, go to Monkeytype and take 5x 15 second tests. Record your best score each day.

First

[Keybr](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.keybr.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1745705858138130&usg=AOvVaw0gb5C76SKB9oCd7BV0HL9o) - This test needs to be finished before starting any other activities.

- Read all the instructions before you start.
- Create an account to keep track of progress.
- Unlock all letters as green before moving on
- If it takes you the full 5 days to complete this that’s fine

After Keybr is completed and all letters are green, here’s a list of different ways to practice during your time slots. I’ve grouped them in different tiers of difficulty.

Easy:

1. Go to [Monkeytype](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://monkeytype.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1745705858139945&usg=AOvVaw2aQbJh1OcuTWfm5QairlGv) and choose the “words” category on top.

2. You’ll have 50 words to type with no time limit
3. Focus on finishing each test with no errors
4. Before you start another test, select “Practice Words”, select “Words” for missed words and “On” for slow words and click “Start” and take the new focused test.

5. Open “Zen” mode in Monkeytype

6. Here you wont have words, but you just type what comes to mind.
7. Type in here what you need to accomplish for the day or just some things on your mind.
8. We practice a lot of typing while reading words on a screen, but in the real world you’ll be typing something in your head.
9. Press “Shift - Enter” to finish Zen mode.

10. Go to Monkeytype and select “Custom” then “Change”

11. In the custom box put your full name.
12. Our names are something we type all the time
13. Set it to 30 seconds and practice typing your name.

14. Continue Practice Mode in Keybr

Medium:

1. Go to Monkeytype and select “Quote”

2. This will add capitalization and punctuation to your tests

3. Play [TypeRacer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://play.typeracer.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1745705858143499&usg=AOvVaw1b_NM6zSeDabfkaPPPDTUO)

4. Racing game where you race against other people with similar typing speeds
5. This also includes punctuation

6. Play [Z Type](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://zty.pe/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1745705858144779&usg=AOvVaw075S9JAwkCQIT4WXEDH_3Y)

7. Asteroids based typing game.
8. No punctuation or capitalization

9. Go to Monkeytype and select times over 1-2 minutes

10. Allow yourself to type for longer amounts of time vs a short test.
11. Focus on accuracy

Hard:

1. Go to Monkeytype and select either “time” or “words”

2. Go to Settings and “Funbox”
3. Select “Read Ahead Easy”
4. This will remove the next word as you type forcing you to read ahead while typing.
5. If this is too easy, move to “Read Ahead” or “Read Ahead Hard”

6. Go to [TypeLit.io](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://typelit.io&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1745705858146992&usg=AOvVaw3tkt_7Sq_OVThP4PrxnsnE)

7. This website lets you choose a book and type the chapters.
8. Lots of punctuation and general formatting you must follow
9. Type a page at a time

10. Go to Monkeytype, in funbox settings click “Wikipedia”

11. This will give you prompts that are based on Wikipedia articles
12. Lots of punctuation again, but in the familiar Monkeytype layout

- Try to do all of these activities at least once unless they seem too hard.
- I’d suggest starting with an easy activity first and then moving onto the harder ones.
- At the end of each day, go to Monkeytype and take 5 15 second tests. [Record your best score each day.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1THFQKkgbFbN-oVu93H6iP9spHcjJbnUuy2jRvSquSD8/edit?userstoinvite%3Dfedersdd%2540mail.uc.edu%26sharingaction%3Dmanageaccess%26role%3Dwriter%26gid%3D727613379%23gid%3D727613379&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1745705858149770&usg=AOvVaw0_-tklI5p1GN3yGxhxEuT9)
